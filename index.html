        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, My name is Zahira Leslie Mecina Valencia. I hope to meet you soon. Throughout this short description I hope you are able to learn a little about me. I will be describing some of the things I am well experienced in. I am someone who is well determined and can achieve almost anything if I put my mind to it. I also have a great support system, that is why I feel like I can succeed somewhat in life. I find joy in helping others, that is why I participate a lot in nearby events when I am able to. 
<br><br>

        I attended Mojave Jr/Sr High School; During my time at Mojave, I have made myself pretty well known for having participated in events or clubs that were made there. Starting in my middle school years, I was elected to be Vice President for my class, up until my sophomore year. Then later on, in my senior year of high school, I was proudly given the Executive President AND Executive Treasurer position in the Associated Student Body (ASB) Program. I also was enrolled in dual-enrollment classes while in high school. I participated in sports as well, the sports being Soccer, Basketball, Softball, and Volleyball. I was captain of the Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball teams in my senior year. Since I was part of the Associated Student Body program at Mojave Jr./Sr. High School, I also served food, handled money, prepared and cleaned, and also handled customers to the best of my ability during food courts and snack bars during social events at school; Social events being football and sports games, homecoming, prom, and more dances or social events that were created. Apart from the events I participated in High school, I also participated in church events. I go to a catholic church in my hometown. They feed the homeless and also create food drives. When they do these events, I try to help as much as possible. I also come from a Mexican descent family, so I myself am bilingual in the Spanish and English languages. All of these experiences help me improve more as a person. That is why I like to think of myself as very well-adapted and experienced. Although participating in the school events have inspired me more to continue on the teaching career path. Coming from a Spanish speaking family has inspired me to become an ENGLISH teacher. I am now attending University of California, Riverside (UCR) studying in the English field and hoping to participate in more clubs or events at UCR. 
<br><br>

        I hope you learned a thing or two about me and I also hope you will consider me for your open position. I am greatly thankful that you gave me the opportunity and the time of day so that you were able to get to know a little more about me. This way you are able to consider me even more and hopefully get to know me even more when I have the pleasure to talk to you. You can contact me through email or phone number.
